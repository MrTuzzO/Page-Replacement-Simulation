            <h2>Page Replacement Algorithm Explanation</h2>
            <p>
                <b>First In First Out (FIFO):</b>
                In the FIFO algorithm, pages are replaced in the order they were brought into memory. It operates like a
                queue, where the oldest page is at the front and the newest page is added to the back. When a page needs
                to be replaced and the memory is full, the oldest page at the front of the queue is removed, making space
                for the new page. Then, the new page is added to the back of the queue, becoming the newest page in memory.
                <br><br>
                <b>Least Recently Used (LRU):</b>
                The LRU algorithm tracks the order in which pages are used. When a page is referenced, it is moved to
                the front of the queue, indicating it was the most recently used. If a page needs to be replaced and the
                memory is full, the page at the back of the queue (the least recently used page) is removed to make room for
                the new page. By constantly updating the order based on page usage, LRU ensures that the pages most likely
                to be used again stay in memory.
                <br><br>
                <b>Optimal Page Replacement (OPT):</b>
                OPT is an idealized algorithm that looks ahead to determine which page will be least likely to be used
                in the future. When a page fault occurs, OPT examines the remaining page references in the sequence to
                identify the page that won't be needed for the longest time. While OPT theoretically provides the lowest
                page-fault rate, it is not practical because it requires knowledge of future page accesses, which is typically not
                available in real-world scenarios.
